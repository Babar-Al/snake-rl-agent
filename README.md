# snake-rl-agent
A Deep Q-Learning agent trained to play the classic Snake game using PyTorch and Pygame. This project demonstrates fundamental reinforcement learning concepts including experience replay, epsilon-greedy strategy, and Q-value updates using a simple feedforward neural network.

# Snake Game AI using Deep Q-Learning

This project demonstrates how to train an artificial agent to play the classic Snake game using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, a reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent learns to survive and grow longer by eating food while avoiding collisions.

## üß† Algorithm: Deep Q-Learning

This project implements a **value-based, off-policy** reinforcement learning algorithm called **DQN**:

- **State Space**: 11 features (danger ahead, direction, food location)
- **Action Space**: `[Straight, Right Turn, Left Turn]`
- **Reward Function**:
  - `+10` for eating food üçé
  - `-10` for dying ‚ò†Ô∏è
  - `0` for a regular move (or small penalty if you add one)
- **Learning Method**:
  - Neural network estimates `Q(state, action)`
  - Experience replay using a memory buffer
  - Bellman equation for Q-value updates
